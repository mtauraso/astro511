  abstract = {Stellar distances constitute a foundational pillar of astrophysics. The publication of 1.47 billion stellar parallaxes from Gaia is a major contribution to this. Despite Gaia's precision, the majority of these stars are so distant or faint that their fractional parallax uncertainties are large, thereby precluding a simple inversion of parallax to provide a distance. Here we take a probabilistic approach to estimating stellar distances that uses a prior constructed from a three-dimensional model of our Galaxy. This model includes interstellar extinction and Gaia's variable magnitude limit. We infer two types of distance. The first, geometric, uses the parallax with a direction-dependent prior on distance. The second, photogeometric, additionally uses the color and apparent magnitude of a star, by exploiting the fact that stars of a given color have a restricted range of probable absolute magnitudes (plus extinction). Tests on simulated data and external validations show that the photogeometric estimates generally have higher accuracy and precision for stars with poor parallaxes. We provide a catalog of 1.47 billion geometric and 1.35 billion photogeometric distances together with asymmetric uncertainty measures. Our estimates are quantiles of a posterior probability distribution, so they transform invariably and can therefore also be used directly in the distance modulus (). The catalog may be downloaded or queried using ADQL at various sites (see http://www.mpia.de/ calj/gedr3\_distances.html), where it can also be cross-matched with the Gaia catalog.},

  abstract = {Gaia is a cornerstone mission in the science programme of the European Space Agency (ESA). The spacecraft construction was approved in 2006, following a study in which the original interferometric concept was changed to a direct-imaging approach. Both the spacecraft and the payload were built by European industry. The involvement of the scientific community focusses on data processing for which the international Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC) was selected in 2007. Gaia was launched on 19 December 2013 and arrived at its operating point, the second Lagrange point of the Sun-Earth-Moon system, a few weeks later. The commissioning of the spacecraft and payload was completed on 19 July 2014. The nominal five-year mission started with four weeks of special, ecliptic-pole scanning and subsequently transferred into full-sky scanning mode. We recall the scientific goals of Gaia and give a description of the as-built spacecraft that is currently (mid-2016) being operated to achieve these goals. We pay special attention to the payload module, the performance of which is closely related to the scientific performance of the mission. We provide a summary of the commissioning activities and findings, followed by a description of the routine operational mode. We summarise scientific performance estimates on the basis of in-orbit operations. Several intermediate Gaia data releases are planned and the data can be retrieved from the Gaia Archive, which is available through the Gaia home page at http://www.cosmos.esa.int/gaia.},

The early part, \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} EDR3, gives very precise astrometric and photometric properties for nearly two billion sources together with seven million radial velocities from \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} DR2. The full release, \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} DR3, will add radial velocities, spectra, light curves, and astrophysical parameters for a large subset of the sources, as well as orbits for solar system objects.\emph{Aims.{$<$}i/{$>$} Before the publication of the catalogue, many different data items have undergone dedicated validation processes. The goal of this paper is to describe the validation results in terms of completeness, accuracy, and precision for the \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} EDR3 data and to provide recommendations for the use of the catalogue data.\emph{Methods.{$<$}i/{$>$} The validation processes include a systematic analysis of the catalogue contents to detect anomalies, either individual errors or statistical properties, using statistical analysis and comparisons to the previous release as well as to external data and to models. \emph{Results.{$<$}i/{$>$} \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} EDR3 represents a major step forward, compared to \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} DR2, in terms of precision, accuracy, and completeness for both astrometry and photometry.

  abstract = {Massive galactic lenses with large Einstein Radii should cause a measurable astrometric microlensing effect, i.e. the light centroid shift due to the motion of the two images. Such a shift in the position of a background star due to microlensing was not included in the \$Gaia\$ astrometric model, therefore significant deviation should cause \$Gaia\$'s astrometric parameters to be determined incorrectly. Here we studied one of the photometric microlensing events reported in the \$Gaia\$ DR3, GaiaDR3-ULENS-001, for which poor goodness of \$Gaia\$ fit and erroneous parallax could indicate the presence of the astrometric microlensing signal. Based on the photometric microlensing model, we simulated \$Gaia\$ astrometric time-series with the astrometric microlensing effect added. We found that including microlensing with the angular Einstein Radius of \$\textbackslash theta\_\{\textbackslash rm E\}\$ = \$2.60\^\{+0.21\}\_\{-0.24\}\$ mas (\$2.47\^\{+0.28\}\_\{-0.24\}\$ mas) assuming positive (negative) impact parameter \$u\_0\$ reproduces well the astrometric quantitie reported by \$Gaia\$. We estimate the mass of the lens to \$1.00\^\{+0.23\}\_\{-0.18\}\$ \$M\_\textbackslash odot\$ (\$0.70\^\{+0.17\}\_\{-0.13\}\$ \$M\_\textbackslash odot\$) and its distance to \$0.90\^\{+0.14\}\_\{-0.11\}\$ kpc (\$0.69\^\{+0.13\}\_\{-0.09\}\$ kpc), proposing the lens could be a nearby isolated white dwarf.},

  abstract = {The Gaia satellite will observe about one billion stars and other point-like sources. The astrometric core solution will determine the astrometric parameters (position, parallax, and proper motion) for a subset of these sources, using a global solution approach which must also include a large number of parameters for the satellite attitude and optical instrument. The accurate and efficient implementation of this solution is an extremely demanding task, but crucial for the outcome of the mission. We provide a comprehensive overview of the mathematical and physical models applicable to this solution, as well as its numerical and algorithmic framework. The astrometric core solution is a simultaneous least-squares estimation of about half a billion parameters, including the astrometric parameters for some 100 million well-behaved so-called primary sources. The global nature of the solution requires an iterative approach, which can be broken down into a small number of distinct processing blocks (source, attitude, calibration and global updating) and auxiliary processes (including the frame rotator and selection of primary sources). We describe each of these processes in some detail, formulate the underlying models, from which the observation equations are derived, and outline the adopted numerical solution methods with due consideration of robustness and the structure of the resulting system of equations. Appendices provide brief introductions to some important mathematical tools (quaternions and B-splines for the attitude representation, and a modified Cholesky algorithm for positive semidefinite problems) and discuss some complications expected in the real mission data.},

Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} Data Release 2 (\emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} DR2) contains results for 1693 million sources in the magnitude range 3 to 21 based on observations collected by the European Space Agency \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} satellite during the first 22 months of its operational phase.\emph{Aims.{$<$}i/{$>$} We describe the input data, models, and processing used for the astrometric content of \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} DR2, and the validation of these resultsperformed within the astrometry task.\emph{Methods.{$<$}i/{$>$} Some 320 billion centroid positions from the pre-processed astrometric CCD observations were used to estimate the five astrometric parameters (positions, parallaxes, and proper motions) for 1332 million sources, and approximate positions at the reference epoch J2015.5 for an additional 361 million mostly faint sources. These data were calculated in two steps. First, the satellite attitude and the astrometric calibration parameters of the CCDs were obtained in an astrometric global iterative solution for 16 million selected sources, using about 1\% of the input data. This primary solution was tied to the extragalactic International Celestial Reference System (ICRS) by means of quasars. The resulting attitude and calibration were then used to calculate the astrometric parameters of all the sources. Special validation solutions were used to characterise the random and systematic errors in parallax and proper motion.\emph{Results.{$<$}i/{$>$} For the sources with five-parameter astrometric solutions, the median uncertainty in parallax and position at the reference epoch J2015.5 is about 0.04 mas for bright (\emph{G{$<$}i/{$>$} {$<$} 14 mag) sources, 0.1 mas at \emph{G{$<$}i/{$>$} = 17 mag, and 0.7 masat \emph{G{$<$}i/{$>$} = 20 mag. In the proper motion components the corresponding uncertainties are 0.05, 0.2, and 1.2 mas yr\textsuperscript{-1{$<$}sup/{$>$}, respectively.The optical reference frame defined by \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} DR2 is aligned with ICRS and is non-rotating with respect to the quasars to within 0.15 mas yr\textsuperscript{-1{$<$}sup/{$>$}. From the quasars and validation solutions we estimate that systematics in the parallaxes depending on position, magnitude, and colour are generally below 0.1 mas, but the parallaxes are on the whole too small by about 0.03 mas. Significant spatial correlations of up to 0.04 mas in parallax and 0.07 mas yr\textsuperscript{-1{$<$}sup/{$>$} in proper motion are seen on small ({$<$} 1 deg) and intermediate (20 deg) angular scales.

  abstract = {Gaia Early Data Release 3 (Gaia EDR3) contains results for 1.812 billion sources in the magnitude range G = 3 to 21 based on observations collected by the European Space Agency Gaia satellite during the first 34 months of its operational phase. We describe the input data, the models, and the processing used for the astrometric content of Gaia EDR3, as well as the validation of these results performed within the astrometry task. The processing broadly followed the same procedures as for Gaia DR2, but with significant improvements to the modelling of observations. For the first time in the Gaia data processing, colour-dependent calibrations of the line- and point-spread functions have been used for sources with well-determined colours from DR2. In the astrometric processing these sources obtained five-parameter solutions, whereas other sources were processed using a special calibration that allowed a pseudocolour to be estimated as the sixth astrometric parameter. Compared with DR2, the astrometric calibration models have been extended, and the spin-related distortion model includes a self-consistent determination of basic-angle variations, improving the global parallax zero point. Gaia EDR3 gives full astrometric data (positions at epoch J2016.0, parallaxes, and proper motions) for 1.468 billion sources (585 million with five-parameter solutions, 882 million with six parameters), and mean positions at J2016.0 for an additional 344 million. Solutions with five parameters are generally more accurate than six-parameter solutions, and are available for 93\% of the sources brighter than G = 17 mag. The median uncertainty in parallax and annual proper motion is 0.02-0.03 mas at magnitude G = 9 to 14, and around 0.5 mas at G = 20. Extensive characterisation of the statistical properties of the solutions is provided, including the estimated angular power spectrum of parallax bias from the quasars.},

  abstract = {The history of astrometry, the branch of astronomy dealing with the positions of celestial objects, is a lengthy and complex chronicle, having its origins in the earliest records of astronomical observations more than two thousand years ago, and extending to the high accuracy observations being made from space today. Improved star positions progressively opened up and advanced fundamental fields of scientific enquiry, including our understanding of the scale of the solar system, the details of the Earth's motion through space, and the comprehension and acceptance of Newtonianism. They also proved crucial to the practical task of maritime navigation. Over the past 400 years, during which positional accuracy has improved roughly logarithmically with time, the distances to the nearest stars were triangulated, making use of the extended measurement baseline given by the Earth's orbit around the Sun. This led to quantifying the extravagantly vast scale of the Universe, to a determination of the physical properties of stars, and to the resulting characterisation of the structure, dynamics and origin of our Galaxy. After a period in the middle years of the twentieth century in which accuracy improvements were greatly hampered by the perturbing effects of the Earth's atmosphere, ultra-high accuracies of star positions from space platforms have led to a renewed advance in this fundamental science over the past few years.},

  abstract = {Understanding the formation and evolution of our Galaxy requires accurate distances, ages, and chemistry for large populations of field stars. Here, we present several updates to our spectrophotometric distance code, which can now also be used to estimate ages, masses, and extinctions for individual stars. Given a set of measured spectrophotometric parameters, we calculate the posterior probability distribution over a given grid of stellar evolutionary models, using flexible Galactic stellar-population priors. The code (called StarHorse) can accommodate different observational data sets, prior options, partially missing data, and the inclusion of parallax information into the estimated probabilities. We validate the code using a variety of simulated stars as well as real stars with parameters determined from asteroseismology, eclipsing binaries, and isochrone fits to star clusters. Our main goal in this validation process is to test the applicability of the code to field stars with known Gaia-like parallaxes. The typical internal precisions (obtained from realistic simulations of an APOGEE+Gaia-like sample) are \$\{\textbackslash simeq \} 8\textbackslash,\textbackslash,\textbackslash rm\{per\textbackslash,\textbackslash,cent\}\$ in distance, \$\{\textbackslash simeq \} 20\textbackslash,\textbackslash,\textbackslash rm\{per\textbackslash,\textbackslash,cent\}\$ in age,\,\$\{\textbackslash simeq \} 6\textbackslash,\textbackslash,\textbackslash rm\{per\textbackslash,\textbackslash,cent\}\$ in mass, and {$\simeq$} 0.04\,mag in AV.

For a small fraction of these sources, the astrometric solutions are poor, and the reported values and uncertainties may not apply. Before any analysis, it is important to recognize and excise these spurious results - this is commonly done by means of quality flags in the Gaia catalog. Here, we devise a means of separating 'good' from 'bad' astrometric solutions that is an order of magnitude cleaner than any single flag: 99.3\% pure and 97.3\% complete, as validated on our test data. We devise an extensive sample of manifestly bad astrometric solutions, with parallax that is negative at {$>$} 4.5 sigma; and a corresponding sample of presumably good solutions, including sources in HEALPix pixels on the sky that do not contain such negative parallaxes, and sources that fall on the main sequence in a color-absolute magnitude diagram. We then train a neural network that uses 17 pertinent Gaia catalog entries and information about nearby sources to discriminate between these two samples, captured in a single 'astrometric fidelity' parameter. A diverse set of verification tests shows that our approach works very cleanly, including for sources with positive parallaxes. The main limitations of our approach are in the very low-SNR and the crowded regime. Our astrometric fidelities for all of eDR3 can be queried via the Virtual Observatory, our code and data are public.},

We have generated our catalog (GeDR3mock) using galaxia, a tool to sample stars from an underlying Milky Way (MW) model or from N-body data. We used an updated Besan\c{c}on Galactic model together with the latest PARSEC stellar evolutionary tracks, now also including white dwarfs. We added the Magellanic clouds and realistic open clusters with internal rotation. We empirically modeled uncertainties based on Gaia DR2 (GDR2) and scaled them according to the longer baseline in Gaia EDR3. The apparent magnitudes were reddened according to a new selection of 3D extinction maps. To help with the Gaia selection function we provide all-sky magnitude limit maps in G and BP for a few relevant GDR2 subsets together with the routines to produce these maps for user-defined subsets. We supplement the catalog with photometry and extinctions in non-Gaia bands. The catalog is available in the Virtual Observatory (http://dc.g-vo.org/tableinfo/gedr3mock.main) and can be queried just like the actual Gaia EDR3 will be. We highlight a few capabilities of the Astronomy Data Query Language with educative catalog queries. We use the data extracted from those queries to compare GeDR3mock to GDR2, which emphasises the importance of adding observational noise to the mock data. Since the underlying truth, e.g., stellar parameters, is know in GeDR3mock, it can be used to construct priors as well as mock data tests for parameter estimation. All code, models and data used to produce GeDR3mock are linked and contained in galaxia\_wrap (https://github.com/jan-rybizki/Galaxia\_wrap), a python package, representing a fast galactic forward model, able to project MW models and N-body data into realistic Gaia observables.},
